// Same self-checking-auth philosophy as library.js (Phase 2): every function here is safe to
// call regardless of sign-in state. The difference from Phase 2 is that these functions also
// need a guildId (the writer's founderGuildId) — there's no meaningful "post to the Fireside"
// without knowing which Founder Guild's Fireside. Callers (FiresideBoard, GuildBookshelf) fall
// back to the original local-only storage when either signed out or not in a Founder Guild —
// see the fallback logic where each is used in App.jsx.

// ---------- Founder Guild membership race guard ----------
// Founder Guild membership only lives in founder_guild_members once syncFounderGuildMembership
// (below) has actually completed — and every caller of it (ink-root.jsx's load-time effect,
// sync-context.jsx's post-sign-in effect, joinFounderGuild) fires it off without waiting, same
// non-blocking philosophy as the rest of this module. That's fine for the write itself, but every
// guild-scoped read/write below (fetchFiresidePosts, postFiresideMessage, ...) is gated by RLS on
// that exact row already existing — so a legitimate member who opens the Fireside/Bookshelf
// moments after app load or sign-in, before that backfill upsert has actually landed, would see
// an empty board (select silently filtered by RLS) or a rejected post, even though they are a
// real member and the backfill is already in flight for their own guild.
//
// pendingMembership tracks the in-flight upsert promise per guild id so every function below can
// await the *same* in-flight call before running its own request, instead of either racing ahead
// of it or firing a redundant second upsert. Once syncFounderGuildMembership resolves, its own
// entry is cleared — later calls into these functions for a guild with no pending entry proceed
// immediately, exactly as before.
//
// Every guild-scoped function below (fetchGuildPublishedBooks, publishBookToGuildRemote, ...)
// calls this unconditionally, including for a Player Guild id (92_migration_player_guild_book_
// publishing.sql) — it's a harmless no-op there. A Player Guild's own membership row is written
// synchronously, inline, by create_or_get_own_guild()/join_player_guild_by_code() themselves
// (see schema.sql), not backfilled asynchronously on load the way a Founder Guild's is, so there
// is no equivalent race to guard for that guild type — this map simply never has a pending entry
// for a Player Guild id, so the await below resolves immediately.
