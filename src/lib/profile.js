// be checked server-side at all (see nairaWelcome's history in health-checks.jsx for why that
// mattered).

// Nothing else needs updating after this: published_books/reviews/fireside_posts/
// guild_book_feedback/guild_published_books no longer keep their own author_name/reviewer_name
// copy (see authorDisplayName() and fetchProfileNames() below) — every reader of those tables
// looks the current name up from `profiles` live, via this same row, so a pen name change takes
// effect everywhere the moment this update lands. An earlier version of this function had to
// separately fan a name change out to all five of those tables (propagateDisplayName) precisely
// because each kept its own stale copy; removing the copies removed the need for the fan-out.
