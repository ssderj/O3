// fields (publishStatus/publishedAt, title, description, genre, tags, price, and — for a pack —
// its cover) on the same underlying book or pack record, whichever door it came through. That
// record is what's already mirrored onto the index (see useMetaReport and packSummaryForIndex),
// which is what makes it show up in the Grand Library and stay manageable from Author Studio
// either way — there was never a second publishing system to keep in sync.
//

// in published_books' and guild_published_books' own insert/update policies (see
// min_publish_word_count() in supabase/schema.sql) — this constant only has to match
